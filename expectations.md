## Expectations for the DSSFs

The leaders of the digital scholarship summer fellows program have the following expectations of the fellows:

- Attendance and punctuality
  - Be punctual and prepared for work each morning and afternoon.
  - If you need to miss work for any reason, please let us know as soon as you are able and make sure to complete any required activities.
  - Please be aware that student work is conducted in person except in special circumstances.
- Communication
  - Treat others -- your peers, the leaders of the program, outside collaborators, and guest instructors -- with respect and kindness, making an effort to resolve conflicts amicably.
  - Communicate with your teammates (peers and leaders) about the work you're doing and any issues or concerns that arise.
  - Offer and receive constructive feedback with an open mind. 
  - Be open to others' ideas and perspectives, even when they differ from your own.
- Professional behavior
  - Practice active attention during meetings, workshops, and team discussions by listening attentively, contributing thoughts, ideas, and questions, and taking notes  to recall details of conversations.
  - Participate actively in our team's project work, including making decisions, solving problems, asking for clarification or assistance, and helping others.
  - Engage in collaborative learning during workshops: experiment, practice, ask questions, and seek to understand.
