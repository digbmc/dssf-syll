## Expectations for the DSSFs

The leaders of the digital scholarship summer fellows program have the following expectations of the fellows:

- We expect summer fellows to be punctual and prepared for work each morning and afternoon.
- If you need to miss work for any reason, please let us know as soon as you are able and make sure to complete any required activities.
- To treat others -- your peers, the leaders of the program, outside collaborators, and guest instructors -- with respect and kindness, making an effort to resolve conflicts amicably.
- To communicate with your teammates (peers and leaders) about the work you're doing, including being willing to ask for clarification or help if you need it.
- Contribute actively to team discussions and meetings and take notes as needed; give consistent attention and respect to others while they speak. 
- Take responsibility for your work on the project, including making decisions and solving problems as needed.
- Offer and receive constructive feedback with an open mind. Be open to others' ideas and perspectives, even when they differ from your own.
- Make an effort to learn and practice the skills and tools in workshops; be willing to ask questions, help others, and engage in collaborative learning.
