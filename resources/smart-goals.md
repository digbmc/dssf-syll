When you set goals, make sure they are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound

## Specific

- What will be accomplished? What specific actions will you take?
- Think of this as a mission statement. You should be able to precisely state what the outcome of your work or effort will be.

## Measurable

- What "data" will you use to measure your goal or to determine if it has been met? 
- If this is a long term goal, what milestones (or sub-goals) will you need to meet on the way to achieving it?
- Measurement methods can be both quantitative and qualitative.  Use the measurement form that *best* suites your specific goal.

## Achievable

- Can you reasonably accomplish the goal?  Do you have the necessary skills or resources?
- If you don't currently have the skills need to achieve the goal, how will you acquire them?  These can be some of your measurable milestones.

## Relevant

- Does this particular goal align with broader project or personal goals?
- How is the outcome important?

## Time-bound

- What is the time frame for accomplishing this goal?
- Is it realistic?
