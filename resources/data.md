## What makes a good data viz?

- What's the message of the visualization?
- What questions does it raise?
- What makes it effective?

### Example 1: [Climate Lab: Warming Stripes (2018)](https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2018/warming-stripes/)  (Ed Hawkins, University of Reading)

- What's the message of this viz?
- Why is this effective?

## How do you make a data viz?

### Get data

- Collect it
- Find a dataset
- Clean and organize it
- Get to know the context and effects of the data collection process
- Basic info: try using [wtf csv](https://www.databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/)

### Analyze data

- What types of data do you have? | Numeric | Categoric | geographic | relationships | temporal
- How many variables do you have? How do your variables relate to each other? | quantities/distribution | correlation | part of a whole | change over time | relationships
- What questions can you ask your dataset?

### Create visualizations

- What will you show? 
  - All variables? Relationships between variables? 
  - Summaries? Every data point?
- What graph types would best communicate your data story?
  - Useful resource: [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)
  - Use your imagination! Draw your visualization on paper.
  - For inspiration: [Dear Data project](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), Georgia Lupi & Stefanie Posavec. 
- Design considerations:
  - What methods can you use to convey your variables?
  - How can you make the results visually compelling and communicative?
  - How can you make them more accessible?

### Storytelling

- What should viewers take away from your visualization?
- What kind of contextual information is needed for them to understand it?


## Activity: collecting and drawing data

### Collecting
- How many countries and US states have you lived in? For how long?
- List all the locations, with the approximate number of years you have lived there
- Add your name, each location, and the number of years to [this excell sheet](https://brynmawr.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/dssf/EUkTDIyekKxMmwkVKc4QoyQBmbGNDN1-e7j6KtlIkLjjyA?e=eMmAyo)

### Drawing
- In groups of 3: draw this dataset, however you like
- 2 different versions
