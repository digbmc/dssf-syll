## What makes a good data viz?

- What message does it convey?
- What questions does it raise?
- What makes it effective?

### Example 1: [Climate Lab: Warming Stripes (2018)](https://bpb-eu-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.reading.ac.uk/dist/3/187/files/2018/05/globalcore.png)  (Ed Hawkins, University of Reading)

- What's the message of this viz?
- What questions does it raise
- Why is this effective?

### Example 2: [Wealth, shown to scale](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/)

## How do you make a data viz?

### Get data

- Collect it
- Find a dataset
- Clean and organize it
- Get to know the context and effects of the data collection process
- Basic info: try using [wtf csv](https://www.databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/)

### Analyze data

- What types of data do you have?
  - Numeric, categoric, geographic, temporal, relationships
- How many variables do you have? How do your variables relate to each other?
  - quantities/distribution, correlation, part of a whole, change over time, relationships
- What questions can your dataset answer? What stories can it tell?

### Create visualizations

- What will you show? 
  - All variables? Relationships between variables? 
  - Summaries? Every data point?
- What graph types would best communicate your data story?
  - Useful resource: [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)
  - Use your imagination! Draw your visualization on paper.
  - For inspiration: [Dear Data project](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), Georgia Lupi & Stefanie Posavec; See also the winners of the [Information is Beautiful Awards]
- Design considerations:
  - What methods can you use to convey your variables?
  - How can you make the results visually compelling and communicative?
  - How can you make them more accessible?

### Storytelling

- What should viewers take away from your visualization?
- What kind of contextual information is needed for them to understand it?

## Activity: creating a data visualization using [RawGraphs.io](https://www.rawgraphs.io/)

1. Choose one of the data samples and select a recommended visualization
2. Assign categories and data columns to features
3. Select colors and labels to customize your data viz
4. Export it as an .svg file

### Next steps
- Open the .svg in Illustrator for additional customization
- Find your own dataset to visualize in rawgraphs
- Embed your visualization in your log

## Activity: collecting and drawing data

### Collecting
- How many countries and US states have you lived in? For how long?
- List all the locations, with the approximate number of years you have lived there
- Add your name, each location, and the number of years to [this excell sheet](https://brynmawr.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/dssf/EUkTDIyekKxMmwkVKc4QoyQBmbGNDN1-e7j6KtlIkLjjyA?e=eMmAyo)

### Drawing
- In groups of 3: draw this dataset, however you like
- 2 different versions
