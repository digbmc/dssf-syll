## About the Program

The Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows (DSSF) program is a paid, full-time summer internship opportunity for Bryn Mawr students to learn digital research and publication methods and gain professional experience by collaborating on a public-facing digital scholarship project. Over the course of eight weeks, we will explore key issues and methods in digital scholarship, critical making, and multi-modal research through a combination of hands-on work, instruction, and discussion. Fellows will also have opportunities to present their work, create a personal digital portfolio, and learn about careers in libraries, museums, and digital media and research.
